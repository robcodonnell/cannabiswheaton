      <h2 class="banner-sub">At Cannabis Wheaton we believe there is strength in numbers.  We invest and support a wide range of cannabis cultivation companies that make up our roster of streaming partners each with a unique offering, based on their individual leadership teams and expertise, and specialized growing techniques and innovations.<br><br>Production is diversified across many streaming partners, reducing the risk associated with build-out delays, licensing delays, poor harvests, etc.  <br><br>Given the reduced production risk, Cannabis Wheaton represents the ideal partner for medical clinics and any other distribution channel.

      <h2 class="banner-sub">Currently, significant shareholder value is created as applicant licensed producers advance through the Health Canada licensing process; however, there is limited access and significant risk in investing in those still in the application stage of licensing.  <br><br>Cannabis Wheaton creates an opportunity for investors to access these licensed producers with significant upside potential, while mitigating risk through diversification, value and the expertise of our management team.
